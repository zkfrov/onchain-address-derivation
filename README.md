</dl>

## Setup

1. Install Aztec by following the instructions from [their documentation](https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting_started).
2. Install the dependencies by running: `yarn install`
3. Ensure you have Docker installed and running (required for Aztec sandbox)

## Build

The complete build pipeline includes cleaning, compiling Noir contracts, and generating TypeScript artifacts:

```bash
yarn ccc
```

This runs:
- `yarn clean` - Removes all build artifacts
- `yarn compile` - Compiles Noir contracts using aztec-nargo
- `yarn codegen` - Generates TypeScript bindings from compiled contracts

## Running tests

### Prerequisites
Before running tests, ensure the Aztec sandbox is running:

```bash
aztec start --sandbox
```

The sandbox runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### All tests
Run both Noir contract tests and TypeScript integration tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Noir tests only
Test your contract logic directly:

```bash
yarn test:nr
```

### TypeScript integration tests only
Test contract interactions through TypeScript:

```bash
yarn test:js
```

## Benchmarking

This repository includes automated benchmarking that measures and compares performance metrics across pull requests.

### Metrics tracked
- **Gates**: Total gate count in zero-knowledge circuits (measures circuit complexity)
- **DA Gas**: Data Availability gas costs
- **L2 Gas**: Layer 2 execution gas costs

### GitHub Actions integration
Every pull request automatically:
1. Runs benchmarks on the base branch
2. Runs benchmarks on your PR branch
3. Generates a comparison report as a PR comment
4. Shows performance improvements or regressions

### Running benchmarks locally

```bash
# Ensure sandbox is running
aztec start --sandbox

# Run benchmarks
yarn benchmark
```

Benchmark results are saved to `benchmarks/` directory.

### Adding new benchmarks

Create a new benchmark file extending the base `Benchmark` class or add a new method line to your existing setup:

```typescript
import { Benchmark } from '@defi-wonderland/aztec-benchmark';

export class MyContractBenchmark extends Benchmark {
  async setup() {
    // Initialize your contract and dependencies
  }

  getMethods(context: CounterBenchmarkContext): BenchmarkedInteraction[] {
    const { contract, accounts } = context;
    const [alice] = accounts;

    const methods = [
      // Add the function calls that you want to benchmark here
      contract.withWallet(alice).methods.method(1),
    ] as BenchmarkedInteraction[];

    return methods.filter(Boolean);
  }
}
```

## Contract architecture

The Counter contract demonstrates key Aztec patterns:

### Private-to-Public execution pattern
The `increment()` function is private but enqueues a public `increment_internal()` call. This pattern maintains privacy while updating public state.

### Storage
- **Owner**: Immutable address set at deployment
- **Counter**: Mutable public value

### Functions
- `constructor`: Initializes contract with owner
- `get_owner`: Returns owner address (public)
- `increment`: Private function that enqueues public state update
- `increment_internal`: Internal public function for state modification
- `get_counter`: Returns current counter value (public)

## Development workflow

1. **Modify Noir contracts** in `src/nr/`
2. **Run `yarn ccc`** to rebuild and regenerate TypeScript artifacts
3. **Write tests** in `src/ts/` using generated artifacts
4. **Run tests** with `yarn test`
5. **Format code** with `yarn lint:prettier`
6. **Create PR** and review automated benchmark results

## Code quality

Format all TypeScript and JavaScript files:

```bash
yarn lint:prettier
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass and benchmarks are acceptable
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

The automated benchmarking will run on your PR, providing performance insights compared to the base branch.
